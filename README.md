# CS300
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
For this course, the projects were focused on creating pseudocode and working code for a 
program that will store course information (Code, name, and prerequisites) in a vector data structure. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
This problem took loads of research. Even after all of this research, I was still unable to fully complete the problem unfortunately. 
Data structures are important to understand because they hold many application for development. They allow a developer to organize 
data and can be applied to many areas of Computer Science. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Roadblocks I encountered were tackled by researching the internet and using C++ documents to 
understand certain functionalities. I also was able to consult fellow CS students for extra 
help. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
The knowledge I gained from these projects expanded the tools that I have to designing software. 
I now know better how to use data structures and design algorithms. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I was able to keep the code very modularized so it was easy to maintain it and read through it as well as adapt it to 
other parts of the program.
